Intellisense for CouchDB


Hi, I would like to have a simple Intellisense for CouchDB and looking for colleagues who are interested in creating this with me. A common GitHub project (eg under my account).
Perhaps you have me also an idea / template, how can be created quickly / easily?
Whisch tools your using wie CouchDB ? Wich Editor? IDE? 
Thank you :)
